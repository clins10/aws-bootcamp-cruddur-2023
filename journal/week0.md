#### Install AWS CLI and ensure that it works

I already installed the AWS CLI before now, running the **msiexec** command to run the **MSI installer**, as specified on the [AWS CLI installation Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

```bash
    msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```
To **confirm the installation** i ran the command below
    
    ```bash
    aws --version
    ``` 
    and got the output below

    ```bash
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```
